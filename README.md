# AI-Powered-Deepfake-Detection
AI-Powered Deepfake Detection with Liveness Detection identifies fake images and videos while verifying real human presence. Using a lightweight MobileNet CNN and liveness checks like eye blinking and head movement, it provides real-time, reliable media authentication via a web-based interface.

Overview:
This project presents an AI-driven system for detecting deepfake images and videos while verifying real-time human presence through liveness detection. With the rapid advancement of AI-generated media, deepfakes pose serious risks including identity fraud, misinformation, and spoofing attacks. This system addresses these challenges by integrating deepfake detection and liveness verification into a single, efficient framework.

Key Features:
1. Deepfake detection for both images and videos
2. Liveness verification using eye-blink and head-movement analysis
3. Lightweight MobileNet-based CNN for fast inference
4. Real-time analysis with confidence scoring
5. Secure and user-friendly web interface

Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (MobileNet – Transfer Learning)
Computer Vision: OpenCV
Web Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Utilities: NumPy

System Architecture:
The system follows a modular architecture consisting of media upload, preprocessing, face detection, deepfake classification, liveness verification, and result visualization. The backend handles model inference while the frontend enables seamless user interaction.

Installation & Usage:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Access the application at:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Results:
The proposed system demonstrates high accuracy in detecting manipulated media and effectively prevents spoofing attacks using liveness detection techniques.

Future Enhancements:
1. Audio deepfake detection
2. Mobile and cloud deployment
3. Improved robustness against advanced deepfake techniques



This project is developed for academic and research purposes.
